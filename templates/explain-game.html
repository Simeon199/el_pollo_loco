        <h3> Explanation of the Game:</h3>
        <p>
            Defeat the enemies by throwing bottles at them or jumping on them.
            Keep in mind that the game is only won when all enemies have been defeated.
            Be aware of the final boss. He will attack you and try to scare you away if you get too close.
            In any case, he will attack you when all the other enemies are defeated or when you
            attack him yourself. Have fun playing!
